### Review of last week

#### Order of execution of MAX objects, Integer (int) and Float (flonum) objects


Here the the beginning of a patch that circles bangs and changes the colours of its buttons.

Here you find four examples, demonstrating 
- order of execution (natural and controlled with a trigger object)
- implications of integer and float operations and how to mix them properly
- Why not create closed loops without delays, stack overflow

[Examples](https://dobrian.github.io/cmp/topics/intro-to-max-and-msp/1.Getting-started-with-Max-and-MSP.html)

Here is another small patch you can make to try out and understand how the content of messages is propagated.

### Messages

#### Demonstrate message box using the built-in help.

- messages can be nested.
- if you click a message box, its content will be send to the attached object.
- A message box does not by itself create a bang message, unless you click on it. So in order to send its content, it must receive a bang message.
- $1 .. $9 parameters can be used to send and rearrange arguments for messages or data within a message box or an object.

### Colouring objects - Subpatcher

Sometimes you have code you want to reuse in different locations in your patch or in another patch. In that case you can create a subpatch.

Create a new object and start its name with p, followed by the unique name of your choice. When you hit enter, an new patcher window will open. With `inlet` and `outlet` you define ways to input and/or output data from your subpatch.

In order to use the subpatch in your main patch, just duplicate the newly greated object (`p ....`) and patch it into your code. Here is the source code for the coloured circle project.

#### Here is a small example fo a subpatch

#### Coloured Circle Project, refactored using subpatches.

### Playing tunes with the keyboard

![Computer Keyboard with MIDI](x-devonthink-item://A04BAD89-A6F0-4F5D-8C27-9345E8DA41E2)

This is a simple patch that allows MAX to access the computer's keyboard. Each key has a numerical integer value, it is following the ASCII code. As an example, a capital `A' returns the numberical value *65* the 'a' 97. Try to write a program using the computer keyboard that plays the C Major. The first three notes are already implemented in the patch. 

Attention: Please be aware that the C Major scale only consists out of white keys, so you need to skip some black keys (MIDI pitches) while building up your scale.


### Sequencer

#### Sequencer

Download the sequencer and understand what is happening

Remix the Sequencer with the Demoplayer patch to create a more versatile sequencer that can use richer material. You may also add more channels. Make sure that you only choose short samples.

You can play a melody using the object kslider (keyboard).

### Extra Rock, Paper, Scissors

The folder also contains the beginnings of a Rock Paper Sissors game. Add the missing parts, maybe you also find a way to fix the problem with the game counter. There are a comments in the patch that help you to find your way around.
