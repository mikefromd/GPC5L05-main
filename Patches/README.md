This folder contains patches you can download and run in order to explore what you can do with MAX.

You are encouraged to remix those patches and add your own spin of things by

- multiplying the effects
- adding elements you have seen in class
- adding something you find elsewhere
- try out new things by searching on the web and in the documentation
- copying and pasting examples from the MAX documentation that you can find within MAX.

Have fun!
