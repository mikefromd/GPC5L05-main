## What type of files does this folder contain?

This folder contains patches you can download and run in order to explore what you can do with MAX.

You are encouraged to remix those patches and add your own spin of things by

- multiplying the effects
- adding elements you have seen in class
- adding something you find elsewhere
- try out new things by searching on the web and in the documentation
- copying and pasting examples from the MAX documentation that you can find within MAX.


## How to get those patches to your computer?

Open the folder `Patches`, then open the patch by clicking on its name at the left of the panel, the file content will be displayed. A patch is a text file, but do not edit it!

Next, click on the Download icon at the top of the source panel (right hand of the RAW label) and the file will be saved on your computer. There you can launch it with MAX.

Some patches also need supportive files (subpatches, images, sound and video files). These projects are saved in a folder. In this case, you have two options:

1. You open the project folder and download file by file individually. Ideally, you create a new folder on your machine and copy all files there.
2. You go back to the repository `MAX-Materials`, click at the top on the green button `<> Code` and choose `Download .zip`.. Then you will get the whole repository, including the content of the folder *Patches*. You may need to extract the contents of the repository.


Have fun!
