## What type of files does this folder contain?

This folder contains patches you can download and run in order to explore what you can do with MAX.

You are encouraged to remix those patches and add your own spin of things by

- multiplying the effects
- adding elements you have seen in class
- adding something you find elsewhere
- try out new things by searching on the web and in the documentation
- copying and pasting examples from the MAX documentation that you can find within MAX.


## How to get those patches to your computer?

Open the folder `Patches`, then open the patch you want to download. You will see the code of the MAX patch. It is a text file, but do not edit it!

Next, click on the Download icon at the top of the source panel (right hand of the RAW label) and the file will be saved on your computer. There you can launch it with MAX.


Have fun!
